# Dual Axis Solar Tracking System

## Overview

The Dual Axis Solar Tracking System is a project that utilizes various technologies to create an efficient solar tracking mechanism. The key technologies involved include the Kodular App, ESP32 module, Firebase, Arduino, and several hardware components like the Wi-Fi module, LDR sensor, and servo motor.

## Getting Started

To run the code for the ESP32 module, follow the steps outlined below:

1. **Install Required Libraries**: Open the Arduino IDE and install the necessary libraries. The required libraries include WiFi, Firebase_ESP_Client, Wire, Adafruit_Sensor, and Adafruit_BME280.

2. **Network Configuration**: Insert your Wi-Fi network credentials (SSID and password) into the code to enable the ESP32 module to connect to the network.

3. **Firebase API Key**: Obtain the Firebase project API Key (API_KEY) and insert it into the code. This key is essential for communication with the Firebase platform.

4. **Upload the Code**: Once the libraries are installed, and the network and Firebase details are configured, upload the code to the ESP32 module using the Arduino IDE.

## Hardware Setup

Ensure the proper setup of hardware components, including the Wi-Fi module, LDR sensor, and servo motor. Refer to additional documentation or schematic diagrams for detailed hardware integration.

## Kodular App Integration

For details on integrating the system with the Kodular App, please refer to additional documentation or instructions specific to the app.
